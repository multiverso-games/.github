Yes, we are building Multiverso Games on GitHub. In fact, we've been doing this since **mid 2017**. But unfortunately we can't dedicate ourselves full-time to this dream yet. That's why we imagine that the development of our projects is a little slow at the beginning, as we have our own formal jobs in big tech companies. But what motivates us is this possibility of working on our own projects, inspired and sponsored by our community to develop softwares that will create unique Metaverse experiences!

## üçø Github: An unstoppable community

The open source community is the üíó heart of Multiverso Games and fundamental to how we build software today. Our team is small and distributed throughout Brazil at the moment, but we are always open to welcoming new members.

## üëæ Pixel Worlds

A dystopian and interoperable pixel art Metaverse that provides many uses for popular NFT projects. **Pixel Worlds** will be a Metaverse MMORPG game that uses NFT's for avatars, pets, terrain, accessories, art galleries, music, games and so on. Yes, there will be games within the game. You will be able to have your own arcade with your favorite games inside your Metaverse. It is heavily inspired by **'Ready Player One'.**

Our vision is to create a model for Metaverses with the core values to keep the space open to everyone and to incorporate other NFT projects into the world, giving them tools to build and create their own communities inside their worlds. While there are many 3D designs, we feel there needs to be a 2D metaverse too! Our goal is to push the limits and innovate on this frontier. In the end, we belive that Pixel Worlds will be a fully interoperable Metaverse Game with a flourishing play-to-earn & create-to-earn economy for players, creators, and collectors alike.
